Minecraft: Java Edition - Snapshot 22w13a
=========================================

**Allay**, the mob that nobody is really sure how to pronounce, is now entering the latest Minecraft: Java Edition snapshot. Along with our new shiny blue friend, we've added the **ancient cities**, which have seen some pretty drastic changes since the experimental snapshot a few weeks ago, so make sure you check them out. 

Happy mining!

NEW FEATURES IN 22W13A
======================

*   Added Allay mob
*   Added Ancient Cities

ALLAY
-----

*   Allays will collect all the surrounding items that match the item they are holding
*   Allays will like a player who hands them an item and will bring the items they collect to their liked player
*   If the Allay hears a noteblock play, that noteblock becomes the Allay’s favorite noteblock for 30 seconds. The Allay will stay near that noteblock for that duration and bring its collected items to the noteblock instead of to the player
*   Interacting with an Allay with an empty hand will remove the item the Allay is holding
*   Allays can be found in Pillager Outposts and Woodland Mansions

ANCIENT CITY
------------

Wander the halls of these long-abandoned structures in the Deep Dark depths to uncover some relics long forgotten.

*   Ancient City structures spawn in the Deep Dark biome
*   In chests, guarded by sculk sensors and shriekers, you can find the new Swift Sneaking enchantment
*   You can also find a new mysterious block called Reinforced Deepslate here, which cannot be obtained in Survival
*   Mobs cannot spawn in Ancient Cities

### DIFFERENCES COMPARED TO THE EXPERIMENTAL DEEP DARK SNAPSHOT

*   Many adjustments have been made to Ancient Cities, with new and tweaked structures
*   Loot tables have been adjusted for Ancient Cities, including a separate loot table for the “ice box” structures

CHANGES IN 22W13A
=================

*   The recipes for minecart with chest/furnace/tnt/hopper are now shapeless
*   When broken each minecart variant drops itself as an item, instead of splitting into two items (such as chest and minecart)
*   Only wool and wool carpets now block the sounds coming from noteblocks

TECHNICAL CHANGES IN 22W13A
===========================

*   Added kill\_mob\_near\_sculk\_catalyst advancement trigger
*   Sculk shrieker block state changes
*   Renamed some game events

ADVANCEMENTS
------------

### NEW TRIGGERS

#### KILL\_MOB\_NEAR\_SCULK\_CATALYST

*   Triggered when a player kills an entity next to Sculk Catalyst
*   Conditions:
    *   player - a player for which this trigger runs
    *   entity - a predicate for the entity that was killed
    *   killing\_blow - a predicate for how the entity was killed

SCULK SHRIEKER
--------------

*   Added can\_summon blockstate to the Sculk Shrieker that determines whether a Shrieker can summon a Warden or not
*   Shriekers placed via worldgen will have can\_summon set to true
*   When a Shrieker is placed or generated via Sculk spread, can\_summon is set to false

GAME EVENTS
-----------

Some game events have been renamed, with some of those changes to make them more gramatically consistent:

*   drinking\_finish -> drink
*   entity\_killed -> entity\_die
*   entity\_damaged -> entity\_damage
*   elytra\_free\_fall -> elytra\_glide
*   mob\_interact -> entity\_interact
*   ravager\_roar -> entity\_roar
*   wolf\_shaking -> entity\_shake

The following events have been collapsed into block\_activate and block\_deactivate:

*   block\_press
*   block\_unpress
*   block\_switch
*   block\_unswitch

Other miscellaneous changes to game events:

*   ring\_bell has been removed and replaced with block\_change
*   Both shulker\_open and shulker\_close have been removed in favour of using container\_open and container\_close
*   fishing\_rod\_cast and fishing\_rod\_reel\_in have been renamed to item\_interact\_start and item\_interact\_finish
*   Added ignore\_vibrations\_on\_occluding\_block game event tag with subsequent logic
*   entity\_interact should be dispatched more often when interacting with various mobs
